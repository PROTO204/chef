# Project Chef

## Introduction to the Project
Our solution is an IoT device connected to an application which allows you to organize, diversify, and customize what you eat. The IoT device, which we call ‘Chef Jeff,’ has both eyes and ears, which allows you to view what’s in your fridge even while you are still at the office. He can also listen to you! Tell him commands such as “running low on milk” or “opened pasta sauce, expires in 7 days” and Chef Jeff will update Chef App. Chef App will then notify you the day before the pasta sauce will expire, to ensure you don’t waste it.
